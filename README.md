# Restz
A wrapper for http-request + Gson to easly consume json RESTful web services 
## How to use Restz
Restz is built for lazy dummies like me in mind, so using it is easy. 

### How to instantiate Restz

The default way to instantiate Restz is as follows

```java
 Restz restz = new HttpRequestRestz();
```
### Get requests
Now, given you have a Restz instance, you can do a Get request. 

``` Restz rests;
